A SmartPiggies token explorer

This project is being built for the Ethereal Virtual Hackathon April 15th - April 30th.

The goal is to implment a functional token explorer for the SmartPiggies smart contract using the Aleth.io api infrastructure.

The explorer should list all attributes of a SmartPiggies token, with the purpose of providing users a present view of the SmartPiggies global market.
